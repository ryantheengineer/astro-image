# astro-image
Attempting to make astrophotography processing easier with Python scripts and possibly machine learning

Feature ideas:
* Machine learning recognition, organization, and automatic naming of darks, lights, and flats
* Automatic batched low-end histogram stretching to improve stacking as a pre-processing action
* Machine learning recognition of object type, possibly from raw data to detect whether an object is in frame at all (?)
*
